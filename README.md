# GEE_SAR_landslide_detection
/** Example GEE script for rapid hazard response in Hiroshima, Japan
* Rainfall event: 28 June 2018 â€“ 9 July 2018
* In this example, we define an AOI defined in "Geometry Imports" (see 
* imports.js)
* Code written by Mong-Han Huang, Department of Geology, mhhuang@umd.edu and
* Alexander L. Handwerger, UCLA/JPL, alhandwerger@g.ucla.edu
*/
 
The scripts (imports.js & main.js) are part of the supplementary material of the paper submitted to NHESS in September, 2020.
